## Inspiration

Inspired by the [glitch](http://rosa-menkman.blogspot.nl/) [community](http://jonsatrom.com/) I wanted to create my own glitch creation class in PHP. After some messing around with the GD function of PHP I managed to create a class that nicely glitched _image/jpeg_ images. As an homage to Jon Satrom I called it Satromizer.php, even though I knew a script with the same name already existed, and that an iOS app with the same name also already existed.

After the class was finished I made several scripts to generate a lot of glitched images in a short time span. Being fond of 20th century modernism, I played around with the idea how to tie glitch art to Modernism. Then I came up with the word play _Maleglitch_, a combination of the surname of Kazimir Malevich and glitch. ax710 and I really like Malevich, I mean, I really really like Malevich' work. Combining the glitch with paintings of Malevich brought me something new: Suprematism in a digital universe. We called it __hypersuprematism__.
